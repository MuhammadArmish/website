    <div class="bg-primary p-2 text-white text-center text-xl ">It appears there might be a small typo in your question.
      I believe you meant "Neurology." Neurology is a medical specialty that focuses on the study, diagnosis, and
      treatment of disorders of the nervous system. This includes the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles.
      Neurologists are physicians who specialize in neurology and are trained to manage various neurological conditions.

      Here's a brief introduction to neurology:
      <br>
    </div>
    <h1 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">1. Nervous System Components:
    </h1>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Neurology deals with the complex structures of the nervous
      system, including the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and neuromuscular junctions. These components work
      together to control and coordinate bodily functions.</p>

    <h2 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">2. Common Neurological
      Conditions:</h2>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Neurologists diagnose and treat a wide range of conditions,
      including epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, migraine, neuropathy,
      and various movement disorders. Neurological conditions can affect both the central nervous system (brain and
      spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (nerves outside the brain and spinal cord).</p>

    <h3 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">3. Diagnostic Techniques:</h3>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Neurological examinations often involve a detailed assessment
      of the patient's medical history, a thorough physical examination, and sometimes specialized tests. These tests
      may include imaging studies such as CT scans and MRIs, electroencephalography (EEG), nerve conduction studies, and
      lumbar punctures.</p>

    <h4 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">4. Treatment Approaches:</h4>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Treatment modalities in neurology vary depending on the
      specific disorder. Neurologists may prescribe medications, recommend physical therapy, provide lifestyle
      modifications, or, in some cases, suggest surgical interventions. Collaborative efforts with other medical
      specialties are common, especially when neurological conditions have overlapping features.</p>

    <h5 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">5. Neurological Emergencies:
    </h5>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Certain neurological conditions, such as strokes or seizures,
      may require immediate attention. Neurologists are often involved in the management of neurological emergencies,
      working alongside emergency medicine specialists and other healthcare professionals.</p>

    <h6 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">6. Research and Advancements:
    </h6>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Neurology is a dynamic field with ongoing research into the
      understanding and treatment of neurological disorders. Advances in neuroimaging, genetics, and pharmacology
      contribute to improved diagnostic accuracy and treatment outcomes.</p>

    <h7 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">7. Neurologists:</h7>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Neurologists are physicians who have completed medical school
      and specialized training in neurology. They may further subspecialize in areas like neurocritical care,
      neurophysiology, or movement disorders. Neurologists work in hospitals, clinics, and research institutions.

      Understanding the intricacies of the nervous system is essential for managing and treating neurological disorders
      effectively. If you have specific questions or need more detailed information on any aspect of neurology, feel
      free to ask!</p>
