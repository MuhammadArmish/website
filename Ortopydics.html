  <div class="bg-primary">
    <div class="bg-primary p-2 text-white text-center text-xl ">It seems like there might be a small typo in your
      question. I believe you meant "Orthopedics." Orthopedics is a medical specialty that focuses on the diagnosis,
      treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation of conditions and injuries related to the musculoskeletal system. This
      system includes bones, joints, ligaments, muscles, tendons, and other connective tissues.

      Here's a brief introduction to orthopedics:
      
    </div>
    <h1 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">1.Scope of Orthopedics:</h1>

    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Orthopedic specialists, known as orthopedic surgeons or
      orthopedists, deal with a wide range of musculoskeletal issues, including fractures, dislocations, sprains,
      strains, arthritis, deformities, and more. They address both acute injuries and chronic conditions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">2.Common Conditions:</h2>

    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Orthopedic conditions can affect people of all ages. Some
      common orthopedic conditions include osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fractures, torn ligaments or tendons,
      spinal disorders, and sports injuries.</p>

    <h3 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">3.Treatment Approaches:</h3>

    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Orthopedic treatments vary depending on the specific condition
      but may include non-surgical interventions such as physical therapy, medications, and lifestyle modifications.
      Surgical options range from minimally invasive procedures to complex surgeries for joint replacements or spinal
      surgeries.</p>

    <h4 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">4.Subspecialties:</h4>
    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Orthopedics has various subspecialties, including sports
      medicine, hand surgery, spine surgery, pediatric orthopedics, and joint replacement surgery. Each subspecialty
      focuses on specific areas within the field.

    <h5 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">5.Diagnostic Techniques:</h5>

    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Orthopedic specialists use a combination of medical history,
      physical examinations, and imaging studies (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans) to diagnose conditions accurately. This
      comprehensive approach helps determine the most suitable treatment plan.


    <h6 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">6.Rehabilitation:</h6>

    <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">After surgery or as part of conservative treatment,
      rehabilitation plays a crucial role in helping patients regain strength, mobility, and function. Physical
      therapists often work closely with orthopedic specialists to optimize recovery.</p>

    <h7 class="display-4 bg-primary p-2 text-white text-start text-l bolder list-inline">7.Advancements in Orthopedics:
    </h7>
      <p class="p-2 text-white text-start text-l display-6">Like many medical fields, orthopedics continually evolves
        with advancements in technology and surgical techniques. This includes the development of new implants,
        robotic-assisted surgeries, and innovative rehabilitation approaches.

        Orthopedics plays a vital role in enhancing the quality of life for individuals with musculoskeletal issues. If
        you have specific questions or want more detailed information on a particular aspect of orthopedics, feel free
        to ask!</p>
